- major overhaul of EC2 cluster control
  - [x] fixed: pip installation from git clone was not working
  - [x] moved: ec2 express cluster recipes into their own source file
  - establish separation between resources, actions
    - [x] add configurable.Var and resource.Ref
    - [x] add configurable.Phase to represent nestable tasks
    - [x] relocate JSONSetEncoder to format.py
  - make sure all AWS created resources have names prefixed with cluster name
  - restore EC2 express cluster ops to full working order
    - [x] up, down, ssh
    - [ ] start, stop
    - [ ] pull, build
  - proper ordering of construction, destruction is more than just forward and backward
    it requires dynamic ordering of phases across resources as constructed
    approach: combine resource life cycle callbacks into a single method
    - [ ] restructure config validation, resource connection, elaborate, up, down methods as schedulable actions
    - [ ] make config validation, resource connection explicit phases
  - preliminary credentials check for services
    - [ ] github access token
    - [ ] AWS/boto3 control panel access
  - handle explicit and implicit scaling groups with explicit resource.Array class
- porting to lambda
  - lambda up
    - create iam role
    - create lambda function
    - create api gateway trigger    
  - lambda down
  - lambda pull
  - lambda alias
